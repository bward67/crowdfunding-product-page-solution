I will always remember this challenge as it was the turning point for me to help understand JS better. It is not perfect and in many places it is NOT PRETTY, but I got there in the end. I spent far more time on this than on any other challenges but that was because I was too stubborn to give up :).

The only thing that is not working perfectly is when the user is on the Back to Project overlay and they click more than once a circle - the template (which is what I used to create the - Enter your Pledge - value and continue button section) does not toggle like the cyan border and dot do. But it does remove when you click on an different circle.

I thought it would be cool if when you click a select rewards button the page would scroll to that exact item when the back this project overlay pops up. I played around with scrollIntoView but could not get it working in all cases. I set up scrollIntoView to the top of the BTP overlay when you click the Back thisProject button but it only works for the mobile size.

I borrowed the numberWithCommas function (guilt-free) from Wes Bos' JS30 as he borrowed it from someone as well.

When in mobile size it was not obvious when the bookmark was clicked so I turned the inside of the bookmark button white.

On the main overlay, if the button reads - out of stock - and the user clicks on that button I made it do nothing so that it would not go to the back this project overlay.
And when an item is out of order on the back to project page I removed the clickable circle and moved the item title and blue pledge line to the right to line up as it was when there was a button.

Looking forward to the next challenge!
